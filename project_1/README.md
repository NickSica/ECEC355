This is to help guide you, not for cheating purposes.   
If you are reading this when I'm out of the class go ahead and do whatever, you'll get caught if it is very obvious.   
 
To build the program type make, to run it with the example cpu trace type make example, and to run it with the matrix multiplication type make matrix.    
The matrix assembly is in the cpu_traces folder and the easier to read version is just called matrix(you want to run uncommented_matrix through the simulator).   
Also, don't forget to uncomment the necessary sections to set the default values.
