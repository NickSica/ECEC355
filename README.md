# ECEC355   
For Drexel's ECEC355 course   
This is intended to help guide you, not for cheating purposes.   
If you are obvious with your cheating you will probably get caught, it's hard to circumvent the software they built to flag cheaters.   
Things were changed slightly, but you should still be able to use it, it seems he split our assignment 1 into 3 different assignments.   
Our assignment PDFs are posted in their folders. Good luck!
